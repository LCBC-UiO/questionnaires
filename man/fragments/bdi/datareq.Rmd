### Column names
By default, the functions assume that columns have names in the manner of `bdi_XX` where `XX` is a zero-padded (i.e. zero in front of numbers below 9, eg. `09`) question number of the inventory. 
You may have column names in another format, but in that case you will need to supply to the functions the names of those columns using tidy-selectors (see the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages for this).
The columns should adhere to some naming logic that is easy to specify.

### Data values
The values in the columns should be the item number of the question that was answered (i.e. `0`, `1`, `2`, or `3`). 
The inventory allows subjects to respond to several options per question, in the case of this, the mean of the responded alternatives should be applied.
