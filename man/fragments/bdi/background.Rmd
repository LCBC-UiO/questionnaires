Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) is one of the most widely used instruments for measuring the severity of self-reported depression in adolescents and adults. 
As a general rule, BDI-II is administrated in LCBC to adults with an upper cut off around 60 years, while depression in older adults is assessed with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). 
However, please consult the instructions for each project, as this guideline has been implemented at different time points across the projects.
