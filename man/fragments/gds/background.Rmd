The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is an instrument designed specifically for rating depression in the elderly. 
It can be administrated to healthy, medically ill, and mild to moderately cognitively impaired older adults. 
As a general rule, GDS is administrated in LCBC to older adults with a lower cut off around 60 years. 
However, please consult the instructions for each project, as this guideline has been implemented at different time points across the projects. 

The questionnaire consists of 30 questions tapping into a wide variety of topics relevant to depression, including cognitive complaints, motivation, thoughts about the past and the future, self-image, and mood itself. 
The answers should be based the participants' feelings throughout the last week. 

Twenty of the questions indicate the presence of depression when answered positively, while the ten remaining indicate depression when answered negatively (see scoring instructions below). 
The questionnaire is scored accordingly, giving one point for each statement that affirms a depressive symptom. 
The sum of these scores yields one total score, with a possible range between 0 and 30.
