### Column names
The package functions expect the data to be named in a specific way, and to not contain data other than the BFI-2 data.
Column names should be zero-leading two digits to indicate the question number, and they should end with these two digits. 
If this system is followed, then all functions work out of the box.

Examples that work:

- `bfi_01` `bfi_02` ... `bfi_59` `bfi_60`
- `big_five_01` `big_five_02` ... `big_five_59` `bbig_five_60`

Examples that won't work

- `bfi_1` `bfi_2` ... `bfi_59` `bfi_60`
- `big_five_01_trust` `big_five_02_change` ... `big_five_59_test` `bbig_five_60_lat`

### Data values
The data should be coded with the original scoring system 1-5.
The data should **not** have implemented necessary reversal of answers for any of the questions, the functions will take care of this.
