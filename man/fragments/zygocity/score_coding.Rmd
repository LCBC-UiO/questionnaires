"Form value" is the value the answer option has in the data file.
"Score value" is the value used in the algorithm when zygocity is calculated.

| Variable            | Answer option           | Form value | Score value |
| --------            | --------------------    | ---:       | ---:        | 
| Drop                | Like two drops of water | 1          |           1 | 
|                     | Like most siblings      | 2          |          -1 | 
|                     | Don't know              | 3          |           0 | 
| Stranger            | Often                   | 1          |           1 | 
|                     | Occasionally            | 2          |           0 | 
|                     | Never                   | 3          |          -1 | 
|                     | Don't know              | 4          |           0 | 
| Belief              | Monozygotic             | 1          |           1 | 
|                     | Dizygotic               | 2          |          -1 | 
|                     | Don't know              | 3          |           0 | 
| Eye, Voice & Dexter | Exactly the same        | 1          |           1 | 
|                     | Almost like             | 2          |           0 | 
|                     | Different               | 3          |          -1 | 
|                     | Don't know              | 4          |           0 | 

No answer option is used directly in the calculations, only the score values. 
In the following, it is these values (-1, 0 or 1) that are used in the algorithms. 
E.g. has Drop in the formula value 1 for a positive answer to whether the twins were equal to two drops of water.
