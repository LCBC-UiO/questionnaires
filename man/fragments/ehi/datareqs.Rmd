One row of data should refer to a single questionnaire answered, and as such, if a person has answered multiple times, these should appear on separate rows with columns identifying ID and time point per observation.

### Column names
For ease, we recommend naming the columns in a consistent way, so the functions in this package become easier to use. 
The LCBC database follows a naming scheme that prefixes all columns with `ehi_` and ends with a zero-padded double digit indicator of the question number.

### Data values
The cell values in the data should be coded from -2 through 0 to 2, and there should be a single value per question. 

|value|category               |
|--:  |:--                    |
| -2  | Left hand dominance   |
| -1  | Left hand preference  |
|  0  | No preference         |
|  1  | Right hand preference |
|  2  | Right hand dominance  |
